            <p>When Matt Shultz isn't playing arenas with garage-rock kings Cage the Elephant, you'll often 
            find him camped out in a tiny vintage-clothing shop. The 32-year-old spends hours hunting for the 
            next piece of his grunge-chic wardrobe, mixing unpretentious staples with unexpected flair – a touch 
            of Bowie glam or a bit of cowboy cool, like his signature-edition Vans boots." A couple hundred bucks 
            on a jacket is expensive for me," says the Kentucky native. "I stay away from trends instead of 
            trying to become a fashion icon."(Rollingstone.com)</p>

            <p>“There is a theme of some of the struggles he was going through with his divorce,” said his brother, rhythm guitarist Brad Schultz.
                “But there was so much loss we were all going through. Family members and very close friends of ours passed away. It was a brutal couple of years.”
                “It’s a record of loss and its different forms. There’s an undertone that there is hope through all that and there is a light at the end of the tunnel.”(Entertainment.com)</p>

            <p>"Jared Lloyd Champion (born February 27, 1983) is the drummer for American rock band Cage the Elephant. Born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, he now lives in Nashville, 
                Tennessee with his wife and two daughters. After Cage the Elephant formed in 2006, Champion, along with the rest of the band, moved to the United Kingdom to gain 
                moderate success with their self-titled debut LP, releasing in Europe on June 23, 2008, and in the United States on March 24, 2009.[4]" (Wikipedia.com)</p>
